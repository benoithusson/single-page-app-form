Next step : 

1. scss code optimisation with using of variables / mixins and extense 

2. Form validation : with trim() method or Joi
error object is here but I can't figure out why this object comes only after the validation of the second form and not the first one

3. Disabled Button : By default, disabled is set to true (can't click on the button)
If the user doesn't give the required information, he can't go on the next form
